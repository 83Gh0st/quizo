## OpenAI Features

Quizo uses **OpenAI** to enhance quiz functionality. Examples include:

- **Dynamic Question Suggestions**: Generate new quiz questions dynamically.
- **Intelligent Hints**: Provide hints to users based on AI-powered insights.
- **Answer Feedback**: Leverages AI to evaluate and generate detailed feedback for answers.

The OpenAI integration is handled in `src/components/Openai.js` and the API route at `src/pages/api/openai.js`.

### Configuring OpenAI

Ensure your `.env` file contains your OpenAI API key:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

You can update OpenAI-related functionality in `OpenAIHelper.js`.

## MongoDB Integration

Quizo uses **MongoDB** to store quiz data, including:

- Questions and answers
- User progress and scores

Update the MongoDB URI in your `.env.local` file:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```

Database connection logic can be found in `src/lib/mongodb.js`.

## Customization

### Adding Questions

To add questions, you can either:

1. Edit the `src/data/questions.js` file for static questions.
2. Use the MongoDB database to dynamically load questions.

### Modifying the User Interface

Modify the UI components located in the `src/components/` directory. Examples:

- **Question.js**: Handles individual question rendering.
- **Quiz.js**: Manages quiz flow and user interactions.

You can also customize the styling in the `src/styles/` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the app:

1. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the contents of the `.next` folder to a hosting service like:

   - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
   - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Ensure your production environment includes the required `.env` variables.
