## Customization

### Adding Questions

To add questions, edit the `src/data/questions.js` file. Each question is an object with the following structure:

```javascript
const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the capital of France?",
    options: ["Berlin", "London", "Paris", "Madrid"],
    answer: "Paris",
  },
  // Add more questions here
];
```

- `question`: The text of the question.
- `options`: An array of answer choices.
- `answer`: The correct answer.

### Modifying the User Interface

Modify the UI components located in the `src/components/` directory. Examples:

- **Question.js**: Handles individual question rendering.
- **Quiz.js**: Manages quiz flow and user interactions.

You can also customize the styling in the associated CSS files.
